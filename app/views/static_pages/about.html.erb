				<h3>Faculty/Course Questionnaires made easy!</h3>

				<p> This website was made to help better understand the FCQ data found at <a href='http://www.colorado.edu/fcq/' target="_blank"> CU's own FCQ website</a>. All of the data on our site is directly pulled from official data stores and we try to keep it as recent as possible. The most recent FCQ download we made was for Fall 2014. We hope you find the website useful for understanding teacher performance and course stats. Feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/cufcq/cufcq" target="_blank">source on github and submit a pull request if you feel anything can be done better.</a></p>
